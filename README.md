## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code

The goal is to make the LED on the board shine blue.

```python
import board
import neopixel

dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1)
dot.brightness = 0.5 

print("Make it blue!")

while True:
    dot.fill((0, 0, 255))
```


### Evidence
Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here

### Images
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

### Reflection
I had issues with the new process of uploading code to the board by saving it to the Python hard drive. After getting my pc to recognize my Python drive saving the code to the folder was easy. 


## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code

```python
Code goes here
"""CircuitPython Essentials Servo standard servo example"""
import time
import board
import pwmio
import servo

# create a PWMOut object on Pin A2.
pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.A2, duty_cycle=2 ** 16, frequency=100)

# Create a servo object, my_servo.
my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)

while True:
    for angle in range(0, 180, 5):  # 0 - 180 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.05)
    for angle in range(180, 0, -5): # 180 - 0 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.05)
```
